# Movies Recommendation App
## ⚠️ Attention
This project is a work in progress. Still have quite a lot of work to do:
- authentication, with Spring Security
- Movie page design and display
- Might do a list of favorites and then add a "recommendations" category based on those favorites

Key challenges in this project include integrating with a movie API to fetch real-time data, storing it in database, designing an intuitive and visually appealing user interface, implementing navigation between different pages efficiently, managing state and data flow within the React components.

A full stack movies recommendation application using React and Spring Boot.
