At first I was trying to make a movie-rental application but I thought it was pretty pointless considering I had no need for it at all.
After a bit of thinking I endend up with the diea of making a movie-recommendation app which I could even use for myself.
This way I can put more effort and passion into this project since it can solve a use for me.

TODO :
use spring seucirty to build authentication feature in front and back
build a cart feature for each user

use postman
build api 
to unit testing with junit / mockito



Key challenges in this project include integrating with a movie API to fetch real-time data, designing an intuitive and visually appealing user interface, implementing navigation between different pages efficiently, managing state and data flow within the React components, and incorporating bonus features like user authentication, watchlists, and review functionalities seamlessly into the app.
